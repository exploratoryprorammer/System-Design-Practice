### Design Spotify Top K Songs

Background: Typically there are four types of windows in stream processing systems:
tumbling window, sliding window, session window, and global window

Global window: window that covers the entire period of data. In context: global window means top k songs of all time 
Tumbling window: fixed size window that does not slide: In context: tumbling window means top k songs of a predefined time interval 
Sliding window: dynamic window that slides over time. 
 -- Example if we set up a sliding window of 10 minutes wiht a slide interval of 1 minute,
 all events in the last 10 minutes will be in the same window, but every minute, the window will
 slide forward by 1 minute. 
 -- Fixed sliding window: the window size and slide interval are predefined, events are bucketed along a fixed time axis 
 -- Arbitary sliding window: the slide interval is not fixed. The window sizde is predefined. Events are bucketed along a dynamic time axis
 meaning the windows open and close based on when events arrive
