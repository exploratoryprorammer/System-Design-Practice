Problem:
Functional requirements: 
User should be able to create, read, update, and deelete a google docs from their web browser
Users should be able to view changes on and edit a google docs owned by a different user concurrently 
Scale Requirements:
DAU: 1 million 
Traffic spike: 5x during peak hour
Avg document size: 100KB
Edit frequency: 1 edit per second
Up to 100 concurrent Users
Non Functional:
Hihgly available low latency, eventual consistency, Read-your-writes-consistency

High Level Design 
Document File URL structure: we would not use a directory file url structure as we do not want to expose collaborators to different file in the subdirectory
This is why we use a flat file structure

Store Documents: Metadata 
We will need to have fast queries and filtering
We will need to maintain data integrity: we want to make sure metadata is consistent and accurate
We also need transactional consistency
We will need a relational database

Storing Documents: Document Content 
Larger and less structured than metadata for text, images and othe rich media. 
Version History 
This is why we need to use cloud object storages 
- They can handle alot of unstructured data
- They are optimized for high throughput, scalability and durability.
- Cost effective
