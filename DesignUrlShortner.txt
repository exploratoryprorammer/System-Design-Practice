Functional Requirements

We extract verbs from the problem statement to identify core operations:

"takes a long URL and generates a shorter alias" → CREATE operation (URL Shortening)
"redirects users to the original URL" → READ operation (URL Redirection)
"track link usage" → UPDATE/INCREMENT operation (Analytics)
Each verb maps to a functional requirement that defines what the system must do.

Users should be able to input a long URL and receive a unique, shortened alias. The shortened URL should use a compact format with English letters and digits to save space and ensure uniqueness.

When users access a shortened URL, the service should redirect them seamlessly to the original URL with minimal delay.

The system should be able to track the number of times each shortened URL is accessed to provide insights into link usage.

Out of Scope

Authentication and Authorization for users (e.g., who can create URLs or access certain analytics).
Expiration or deletion of URLs by users.
Advanced analytics beyond click counts (e.g., geographic tracking or device types).
Scale Requirements

100M Daily Active Users
Read:write ratio = 100: 1
Data retention for 5 years
Assuming 1 million write requests per day
Assuming each entry is about 500 bytes


Non-Functional Requirements

We extract adjectives and descriptive phrases from the problem statement to identify quality constraints:

"unique" alias → System must guarantee no collisions
"millions of URLs" + "high traffic" → System must handle large scale
"efficiently" + "near real-time" → System must respond quickly
"persistent" → System must not lose data
"handle high traffic" → System must remain operational under load
Each adjective becomes a non-functional requirement that constrains our design choices.

High Availability: The service should ensure that all URLs are accessible 24/7, with minimal downtime, so users can reliably reach their destinations. (Derived from 'high traffic')
Low Latency: URL redirections should occur almost instantly, ideally in under a few milliseconds, to provide a seamless experience for users. (Derived from 'near real-time' and 'efficiently')
High Durability: Shortened URLs should be stored reliably so they persist over time, even across server failures, ensuring long-term accessibility. (Derived from 'persistent')
Uniqueness: Each shortened URL must map to exactly one original URL across all users. (Derived from 'unique')
Security: The service must prevent malicious links from being created and protect user data, implementing safeguards against spam, abuse, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.


Solution: 

Data Model: You have two data tables the URLMapping and the Analytics table which have a one to one Relationship
URLMapping has these peices of data
shortURL: strings
originalURL: string 
createdAt: string

Analytics:
shortURL: string
click_count: integer 
last_accessed: timestamp


API endpoints:

CREATE post request: takes a original url and
