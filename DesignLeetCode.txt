Problem: 
Question bank store thousands of programming questions. Users should be able to write, compile and submit code against test cases and recieve feedback immediately.
The code submitted by users should be persisted 
Every week there is a contest where thousands of users concurrently submit solutions to leetcode problems. WRITE/READ
There is a leaderboard which shows the ranking of participants in real time during the 2 hours. WRITE/READ
After the contest ends, the leaderboard becoems a frozen historical representation of the contests. READ

Functional Requiremnts: 
READ: view programming question and question bank, and solution of the users, compilation of the programming question, testing the code against the test cases to get immediate feedback
WRITE: write a solution to the programming question which should persist. Thousands of users concurrently submit solutions to their 
UPDATE: User should be able to compete in a ranked competetion with real time updates.

Non Functional Requiremnts:
Thousands of people concurrently  => high Concurrency
Immediate feedback + real time updates => low latency 
persistance => system must be durable and safe
implicit => secure.


Solution: 

High level design:
View problem:
Client: Frontend application sends an http get request command
Problem Service: Service has two methods one for list all problems and one for get problem by name
Database: Stores problme data: id, problem name, description with constraints, difficulty, example solutions

Submit Solution: 
Client: Frontend applicatin sends an http create request command
Problem Service: Service has one method where you submit a solution to the problme
